# OpenSCAD

In the course of working on projects like my <a href='https://github.com/avirtuos/ros_hercules'>autonomous rover</a> or <a href='https://github.com/avirtuos/waveshare'>Waveshare's 7.5in 3-Color E-Ink Display</a>, I realized that I really needed to understand how to take advatage of my 3D printer to create parts for my projects. This repository catalogs most of those parts in the hopes that others might a) find them useful for their own projects or b) be able to learn from the code snippets. 

## Example - waveshare

In each folder over this repo I'll try to include the scad files, images of the print, images of the STL rendering, and any parts lists.

For example, the first one I added was for Waveshare's 7.5in 3-Color E-Ink Display. Documentation for this thing is sparse (at best) so take a look at my <a href='https://github.com/avirtuos/waveshare'>tutorials</a> if you are considering getting one. 

Here is the actual display:

And here is a case for the display, a raspberry pi zero w, lipo-charger, and lipo:
