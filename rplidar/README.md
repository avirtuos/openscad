# RPLidar 360 (A1)

This repository contains a case for SLAMTech's RPLidar 360 (A1) that protects the lidar and has room for a raspberry pi zero w. Suprisingly the pi zero w has enough horsepower to process up to 10hz from the lidar while also running hector_slam, telemetry, and a geotiff node. Basically with this case and a pi zero w you can have a self-contained lidar navigation system.
